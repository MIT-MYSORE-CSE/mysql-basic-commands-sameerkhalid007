2. DROP: It is used to delete both the structure and record stored in the table.
Syntax:
DROP TABLE ;

3. ALTER: It is used to alter the structure of the database. This change could be either to modify the 
            characteristics of an existing attribute or probably to add a new attribute.
Syntax:
	   To add a new column in the table
        ALTER TABLE table_name ADD column_name COLUMN-definition;    
	   To modify existing column in the table
        ALTER TABLE MODIFY(COLUMN DEFINITION....);

ALTER TABLE STU_DETAILS MODIFY (NAME VARCHAR2(20));  

4. TRUNCATE: It is used to delete all the rows from the table and free the space containing the table.
Syntax:
        TRUNCATE TABLE table_name;  
Example:
        TRUNCATE TABLE EMPLOYEE;  

5. INSERT: The INSERT statement is a SQL query. It is used to insert data into the row of a table.
Syntax:
        INSERT INTO TABLE_NAME(col1, col2, col3,.... col N) VALUES (value1, value2, value3, .... Value n);  
Or
        INSERT INTO TABLE_NAME VALUES (value1, value2, value3, .... Value n);    
Example:
        INSERT INTO javatpoint (Author, Subject) VALUES ("Sonoo", "DBMS");  

6. UPDATE: This command is used to update or modify the value of a column in the table.
Syntax:
        UPDATE table_name SET[column_name1=value1,...column_nameN=valueN][WHERE CONDITION]

        UPDATE students SET User_Name = 'Sonoo' WHERE Student_Id = '3' 
 
7. DELETE: It is used to remove one or more row from a table.

8. GRANT: It is used to give user access privileges to a database.

Example:
        DELETE FROM CUSTOMERS WHERE AGE = 25; 
        ROLLBACK;  

12. SELECT: This is the same as the projection operation of relational algebra. It is used to select the 
              attribute based on the condition described by WHERE clause.
Syntax:
        SELECT expressions FROM TABLES WHERE conditions;
